## <a id="1.0.0"></a> 1.0.0
**Release Date: June 2016**

### Known Issues

* During a stemcell upgrade there will be 2 x ~2 min (time it takes your IaaS to create new VM) intervals where logs 
  are NOT ingested.  This happens when the singleton Queue and Router nodes are recreated.  There is unfortunately
  no workaround at this stage.

* ValueMetrics and CounterEvents consumed from the firehose do contain the incorrect `@source` information - 
  specifically the `@source` information is that of the consuming firehose-to-syslog VM from the PCF Log Search deployment 
  rather than the information about the VM that generated the metric.

* Disabling the "Enable Shard Allocation" errand and applying changes that affect Elasticsearch nodes will prevent new daily indexes from being created.  When updating stemcells it is tempting to disable the "Enable Shard Allocation" errand to speed up the deployment. Unfortunately doing this will leave Elasticsearch in a "broken" state; specifically it will be unable to create new daily indexes at midnight UTC.

  If you suspect this has happened; check whether the your cluster's `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` setting has been set to something other than `all` by querying: `http://logsearch.<system_domain>/elasticsearch/_cluster/settings?pretty`.  If it has, you can correct this by re-enabling the errand in Ops Manager via the Log Search > Errand screen, and Applying Changes.
    
### Notes

* The Log Search tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is now generally avaialable.
